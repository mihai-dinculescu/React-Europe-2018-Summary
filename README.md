This presentation was built onto and features a slide (Confetti demo) from Josh Comeau's presentation at React Europe 2018
https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018#the-case-for-whimsy

Slides 13-19, that introduce the render props, were inspired from the Render Props workshop at React Europe 2018 (Ken Wheeler, Brandon Dail and Emma Brillhart)
